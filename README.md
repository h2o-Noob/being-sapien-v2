# BEING SAPIEN

Hi! My name is **ARINDAM RAINA**, I have created this project to learn MERN Stack web-development and also play my part in a problem that genuinely troubles a lot of us.
Being Sapien is a WebSite where you can report any stray/lost animal you found near house, school, college, workplace or anywhere. The idea is to locate these animal and 
provide necessary aid to them.
